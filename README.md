# CODSOFT-CONTACT-BOOK

## Project Overview
The CodSoft Contact Book is a Python-based desktop application that allows users to manage and organize their contacts easily. It is developed using Python and Tkinter with persistent data storage in JSON format.

This project was created as part of the CodSoft Internship (Python Programming – Task 5). It demonstrates practical skills in GUI programming, file handling, search functionality, and CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Objective
The objective of this project is to design a user-friendly contact management system that helps users add, search, update, and delete contacts with an interactive interface. It provides a real-world example of applying Python concepts to build useful desktop applications.

## Features
- Add Contact – Save details like Name, Phone, Email, and Address
- View Contacts – Displays a list of all contacts (names shown for quick browsing)
- Search Contacts – Instant search with live filtering by name
- Update Contact – Modify an existing contact’s details
- Delete Contact – Permanently remove a contact
- Clear Fields – Reset all input fields with one click
- Auto-Save – Contacts stored in contacts.json for persistence
- Clean User Interface – Left panel for contact names, right panel for details

## User Interface & Layout
The Contact Book GUI is designed with a two-panel structure for better usability:

- Left Panel → Displays a searchable list of contact names
- Right Panel → Shows full contact details with input fields
- Toolbar Buttons → Add, Update, Delete, Clear
- Color Theme → Modern, soft color palette for a professional look

This layout makes managing contacts intuitive and visually appealing.

## How It Works
1. Start the application.
2. Use the Add Contact button to store new entries.
3. Click a contact from the list to view or edit its details.
4. Use Update to modify details or Delete to remove contacts.
5. Use the Search bar to instantly filter names.
6. All contacts are saved automatically in contacts.json.

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.13.7.
2.Clone this repository:
3. Run the script:
python contact_book.py
4. Start adding and managing contacts 

## Conclusion
The CodSoft Contact Book is a practical desktop application that demonstrates the power of Python + Tkinter for real-world solutions. With its intuitive UI, persistent data storage, and essential features, it stands out as a professional internship project.
